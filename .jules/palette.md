## 2024-05-23 - Visual Polish in Backend Logic
**Learning:** In a project where the primary output is text/XML (like an RSS feed), "UI improvements" often require changes to what is technically "backend" code (data providers). Standard constraints about "no backend changes" for UX roles can be ambiguous here.
**Action:** When working on data-centric projects, justify backend text manipulation as "View" logic if it directly affects the end-user's reading experience. Also, always ensure linting is clean even in files I didn't originally author.
