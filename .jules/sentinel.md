## 2024-05-23 - Stored XSS in RSS Feed Generation
**Vulnerability:** The RSS feed generator (`src/build_feed.py`) was taking plain text descriptions (generated by `html_to_text`) and wrapping them in `CDATA` blocks for the `content:encoded` element without escaping. Since `html_to_text` unescapes HTML entities (e.g., `&lt;script&gt;` becomes `<script>`), malicious input could be rendered as executable HTML/JavaScript by RSS readers.
**Learning:** `html_to_text` produces "text" for human consumption, but "text" containing `<` and `>` characters is dangerous when placed into an HTML context (like `content:encoded` in RSS) even if wrapped in `CDATA`. `CDATA` only protects the XML parser, not the downstream HTML renderer.
**Prevention:** Always use `html.escape()` on text content before placing it into `content:encoded` or similar HTML-capable fields in RSS feeds, even if the content is nominally "plain text" and even if using `CDATA`.
