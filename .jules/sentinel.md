## 2025-02-12 - Custom .env Parsing Pitfalls
**Vulnerability:** Incomplete escaping logic in custom `.env` parser allowing secrets with quotes to be corrupted.
**Learning:** Reimplementing standard formats (like shell variable assignment) often misses edge cases like escaped quotes.
**Prevention:** Prefer established libraries (e.g., `python-dotenv`) or rigorous testing of edge cases when implementing low-level parsers.

## 2026-02-02 - Redundant Query Parameter Injection
**Vulnerability:** The VOR provider manually injected `accessId` into query parameters even when `apply_authentication` was configured to use Headers, leading to potential secret leakage in URLs.
**Learning:** Manual overrides in specific API calls can bypass centralized security logic (like `apply_authentication`).
**Prevention:** Rely on centralized authentication handlers (middlewares/hooks) and avoid manual credential injection in individual request functions.
