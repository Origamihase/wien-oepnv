# Audit Report – 2025-12-02

## Summary
- Full project test suite (`pytest`) and dependency integrity check (`pip check`) both succeeded, indicating stable functionality and consistent packaging.
- Manual inspection found no dead code, unused scaffolding in production paths, or unchecked error paths; state handling, caching, and HTTP safeguards remain consistent with prior audits.
- No remediation is required. Continue routine monitoring and keep existing operational safeguards under version control.

## Scope
The review covered:
- CLI entrypoints and configuration loading, including environment variable parsing and default fallbacks.
- Caching, state persistence, and retention policies for feed generation.
- HTTP session configuration, retry/backoff handling, and timeout enforcement for provider integrations.
- Text normalisation, deduplication, and feed validation logic.
- Test suite coverage and dependency health checks.

## Findings
| Category | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture & Robustness | ✅ | Path validation, sandboxing, and defensive defaults remain intact; no regressions detected. |
| Data & State Management | ✅ | Atomic writes and retention rules still guard against corruption and bloat. |
| Error Handling & Monitoring | ✅ | RunReport aggregation and structured logging continue to provide clear observability. |
| Network & Efficiency | ✅ | Retry/backoff, timeouts, and rate-limit handling remain in place; no inefficiencies observed. |
| Normalisation & Consistency | ✅ | Timestamp handling, deduplication, and content sanitisation behave as expected. |
| Tests & Tooling | ✅ | `pytest` (378 tests) and `pip check` both pass without warnings. |

## Recommendations
- Maintain periodic audits and regression tests to catch dependency or provider-side changes early.
- Keep operational safeguards (timeouts, rate limits, logging) documented and versioned alongside code.

## Conclusion
The codebase currently meets reliability, safety, and efficiency expectations. No code changes are necessary beyond continued monitoring.
