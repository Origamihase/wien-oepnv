# Audit Report – 2025-07-08

## Summary
- Comprehensive manual inspection confirmed that the current feed builder implementation is robust and fulfils its design goals.
- No correctness, performance, or security issues were identified; existing safeguards cover logging, state persistence, caching, and path validation.
- No immediate remediation tasks are required beyond maintaining the present operational discipline.

## Scope
The review covered:
- Path validation and sandboxing logic
- Logging setup and rotation strategy
- State handling for `first_seen` persistence
- Cache read/write processes, including failure hooks
- Report aggregation, warning management, and provider polling controls
- HTTP session configuration, retry strategy, and timeout enforcement
- Item normalisation (timestamps, deduplication, and retention filters)

## Findings
| Category | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture & Robustness | ✅ | Path handling strictly limits output targets and provides safe fallbacks to validated defaults. |
| Data & State Management | ✅ | File locking and atomic writes prevent corruption during concurrent updates; retention policies keep state lean. |
| Error Handling & Monitoring | ✅ | Centralised `RunReport` collection and error log handler ensure transparent observability. |
| Network & Efficiency | ✅ | Preconfigured HTTP sessions with retry/backoff and timeout enforcement mitigate transient failures. |
| Normalisation & Consistency | ✅ | Time-based filtering, deduplication, and historical reconciliation keep the feed consistent. |
| Tests | ✅ | `pytest -q` continues to pass; no regression observed. |

## Recommendations
- Continue routine monitoring and periodic audits to ensure safeguards remain effective as dependencies evolve.
- Keep existing logging and retry configurations under version control to document any future adjustments.

## Conclusion
The system currently meets reliability, safety, and efficiency expectations. No code changes are required at this time.
